# gnome-backgrounds-brush-strokes

I created this repository because I liked Gnome’s `brush-strokes` wallpaper.
Unfortunately, it was removed in Gnome 43. I am packaging this wallpaper for the
Arch User Repository, but you can just copy these files to `/usr/local/share` or
some other path that suits your system. If you do, don’t forget to update the
file paths in `gnome-background-properties/brush-strokes.xml`.
